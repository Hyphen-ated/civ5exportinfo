This is a mod for civilization 5 that exports info about what wonders, policies, and religious beliefs you have. You can use this while streaming to display info about those things on your stream, or with a chat bot so viewers can type things like "!wonders" and have the responses automatically be up to date.

You can download the latest version at https://github.com/Hyphen-ated/civ5exportinfo/releases . Download the newest zip file that does not say "source code" on it.

Install it by extracting the zip and then putting the folder called "[mod] Export Info" into your "SteamApps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization V\Assets\DLC" directory.

If it's working, you should see a file called "exported streaming info-1.db" in your "Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 5\ModUserData" directory. (it should be at least 10kb in size)

In order to actually do anything with the result, you need a program to read it, like the one you can find at https://github.com/Hyphen-ated/civ5tracker
